Database instructions
=====================

The database for the game is hosted remotely at http://grandtheftmuffins.esy.es/ on an Apache server. The Apache 
server was installed as a LAMP stack, Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP. The Apache server deals with requests.
The PHP scripts then act as an interface between the game and the MySQL database. The MySQL database contains a Player
table that is updated based on the information received from the game.

The LAMP stack used for testing locally was https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html. XAMPP can be installed locally on a 
machine and the games data access object will communicate with a server locally as well as remotely.
