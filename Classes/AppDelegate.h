	Third year games design and development project. Grand Theft Muffins endless runner game
	written in C++ using the Cocos2dx game engine. http://www.cocos2d-x.org. Back-end game analytics
	and statistics system built using a LAMP stack, Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP. Hosted locally and remotely.

	AppDelegate.h

	Description: AppDelegate is used by Cocos2dx to setup a project on a device. The Window is created using
	GLView and the resources folders are added to the search directories so that the device resolution can be used
	to create assets that will suit different screen sizes. A scene is created and the singleton director will
	control the scene management App Delegate is created as standard in all new Cocos2dx projects and only slight
	modifications are needed to address different device resolutions.
